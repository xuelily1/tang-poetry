早发白帝城  李白
朝辞白帝彩云间
千里江陵一日还
两岸猿声啼不住
千舟已过万重山

Leaving the White Emperor at Dawn

Leaving at dawn the White Emperor with cloud;
I've sailed a thousand miles through canyons in a day.
With monkeys' sad adieus the riverbanks are loud;
My skiff has left ten thousand mountains far away.

dawn 黎明
canyons  峡谷
adieu 告别
skiff 小船
